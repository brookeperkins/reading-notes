## React `setState` (https://css-tricks.com/understanding-react-setstate/)

React components have state (eg whether a user is logged in or not, displaying the correct username when account is active, array of blog posts, whether a modal is open or not, etc.)

setState: the only legit way to update state after setup. 

import React, { Component } from 'react'

    class Search extends Component {
      constructor(props) {
        super(props)

        state = {
          searchTerm: ''
        }
      }
    }

to call setState: 

    setState({ searchTerm: event.target.value })

Reconciliation: this is the process by which React updates the DOM, by making changes to the component based on the change in state. Will only update parts of the DOM when necessary. 

setState is async
can pass setState an object or a function
pass a function when you can to update state multiple times!
do not depend on this.state immediately after calling setState()-- because it's async-- and make use of the updater function instead 

## Lists and Keys (https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html)

JSX vs JS: rendering lists is nearly identical.
render list inside of a component
key: a special string attribute included when creating lists of elements
must be assigned, helps React identify which items have changed, are added or removed
if none provided, React will default to indexes as keys
must be unique among siblings
doesn't get passed to components
most often will use IDs from data

replacement for enzyme

lightweight solution for testing React components

works with actual DOM nodes rather than rendered React components

The test is written in such a way that resembles how the user is using your application.

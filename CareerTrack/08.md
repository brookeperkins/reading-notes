## Using Express Routing (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)

Routing: how an app's enpoints (URIs) respond to client requests
    
    app.get() app.post 
    app.all()--handle all HTTP methods
    app.use() specifies middleware as the callback function
    app.METHOD to see full list

You can use a callback function(handler) or middleware(with app.use()) to create a response

Response methods

    res.download(): for downloads
    res.end(): end response process
    res.json(): for JSON response
    res.jsonp(): ...with JSONP support
    res.redirect(): redirect request
    res.render(): render a view template
    res.send(): send a response back
    res.sendFile(): send a file (octet stream)
    res.sendStatus(): send response status code as a string in the response body

express.Router:routes can be defined and mounted in the main app.

## Supertest (https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)

Supertest is an API that helps with testing http applications
Built on superagent, another API
To use:
  <ol>
  <li>install supertest
  <li>npm install supertest --save-dev
  <li>require it at the top of the file const supertest = require('supertest')
  <li>uses describe...it...
  <li>expectations run in the order they are defined
  <li>supertest can do it if superagent can
  </ol>

## Using middleware (https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html)

Middleware: executes code, change the request and response objects, end the req-res cycle, next
Application: level middleware (app)
Router-level middleware (router): express.Router()
error-handling middleware takes 4 arguments (err, req, res, next)
Built-in middleware
To use the middleware, need to install 
For example, to use the cookie-paraser middleware, need to npm install cookie-parser
load the middleware using app.use(cookieParser())

## Express Middleware (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/expressjs_middleware.htm)

Middleware functions can access the req and res
Executes in order it is defined!

## http status codes (https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html)
List of HTTP Status Codes
100s: informational
200s: success
300s: redirection
400s: client error

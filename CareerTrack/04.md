## PostgreSQL JOINS (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-joins/)

PostgreSQL supports: inner join, left join, right join, full outer join, cross join, natural join, and self-join (special)

    CREATE TABLE basket_a (
        a INT PRIMARY KEY,
        fruit_a VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL
    );

    CREATE TABLE basket_b (
        b INT PRIMARY KEY,
        fruit_b VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO basket_a (a, fruit_a)
    VALUES
        (1, 'Apple'),
        (2, 'Orange'),
        (3, 'Banana'),
        (4, 'Cucumber');

    INSERT INTO basket_b (b, fruit_b)
    VALUES
        (1, 'Orange'),
        (2, 'Apple'),
        (3, 'Watermelon'),
        (4, 'Pear');

joining tables by matching values in the two columns with INNER JOIN: 

    SELECT
        a,
        fruit_a,
        b,
        fruit_b
    FROM
        basket_a
    INNER JOIN basket_b
        ON fruit_a = fruit_b;

// OR selet data from the left table, if values are equal, the left join creates a new row that contains columns of both tables and adds this new row to the result set

    LEFT JOIN basket_b 
   ON fruit_a = fruit_b;

// OR select rows from the left table that do not have matching rows in the right table 

    LEFT JOIN basket_b 
        ON fruit_a = fruit_b
    WHERE b IS NULL;

// OR compare each value of each row in the right on the right table with each value in the right column of every row on the left table. Can also do WHERE x is NULL as above

    FROM
        basket_a
    RIGHT JOIN basket_b ON fruit_a = fruit_b;

//OR return a result set containing all rows from both left and right tables with the matching rows from both sides (if available), if no match, columns will be filled with NULL. Can also do WHERE a IS NULL OR b IS NULL.

    FULL OUTER JOIN basket_b 
        ON fruit_a = fruit_b;

## One-to-one (data model) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-one_(data_model)

One-to-one is just how it sounds, one of one dataset must match one of another dataset in this instance

Eg entity-relationship model, country--capital city (a country only has one capital city, and a capital city is only capital of one country) (or humans in column A must be matched to brains in column B)

## One-to-many (data model) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-to-many_(data_model)

Eg book--pages (one book can have many pages, one page can only be in one book)
one row in table A may be linked with many rows in table B

## Many-to-many (data model) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-to-many_(data_model)

Eg books--authors (an author can write several books, and a book can be written by several authors)

associative table (join table, junction table, cross-reference table) eg AB with two one-to-many relationships 

A -> AB and B -> AB

the primary key is formed from the two foreign keys (ie copies of A and B)

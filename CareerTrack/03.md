## Inside a Computer (https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/inside-a-computer/1/)

Circuit board called motherboard 
Inside Motherboard: CPU (Central Processing Unit - brain of computer), Heatsink, RAM (Random Access Memory - short term memory, can't store fileed there, RAM is cleared when comp is shut off) 
Hard Drive: provides long-term storage, uses a magnetic platter or solid-state drive (more speed and $$$)
Expansion slots aka PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect) eg video card (resonsible for what you see on the monitor), sound card (or audio card, responsible for what you hear in the speakers/headphone), wireless card (or network card, allows your computer to communicate over a network and access the internet - most laptops don't have this and a lot of motherboards have it built in)
Power supply unit (laptop also has battery)

## PostgreSQL Insert (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-insert/)

Insert a new row into a table with INSERT

    INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, …)
    VALUES (value1, value2, …);

OID is an object identifier, will be returned after INSERT statement as command tag: INSERT oid count
OID serves as a primary key, typically returned as a 0
The COUNT is the number of rows that the INSERT statement inserted successfully
RETURNING clause returns the information of the inserted row
To return the entire row: *

    INSERT INTO table_name(column1, column2, …)
    VALUES (value1, value2, …)
    RETURNING *; (or RETURNING id;) or (RETURNING output_expression AS output_name)

Postgres will use the column default value for insert unless one is provided
NULL/NOT NULL
Strings require ``
Insert dates with 'YYYY-MM-DD'
Getting last insert id: RETURNING id

## PostgreSQL Select (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-select/)

SELECT to query data from a table

    SELECT
      select_list
    FROM
      table_name;

SELECT has these clauses: 
<ul>
<li>Select distinct rows using DISTINCT operator
<li>Sort rows using ORDER BY clause
<li>Filter rows using WHERE clause
<li>Select a subset of rows from a table using LIMIT or FETCH clause
<li>Group rows into groups using GROUP BY clause
<li>Filter groups using HAVING clause
<li>Join with other tables using joins such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, CROSS JOIN clauses
<li>Perform set operations using UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT
</ul>

FROM is evaluated before SELECT 
Use a comma if referencing multiple columns, * if referencing all
FROM clause is optional, only if querying data

## PostgreSQL UPDATE (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-update/)

UPDATE statement used to update existing data in a table

    UPDATE table_name
    SET column1 = value1,
    column2 = value2,
    ...
    WHERE condition;

## PosgreSQL DELETE (https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-delete/)

DELETE statement to delete data from a table
can delete multiple/all rows from the table

    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;

    RETURNING (select_list | *) (when you want to return the deleted rows to the client)

## User Modeling

Model sensitive info 
Emails, usernames, addresses: can be stored in plain text (protected database, firewall)
Info like passwords should be encrypted using a hashing algorithm before it's stored
Neither of these models should be sent to client apps
Tip: "If your application requires that users be able to read each others personal information, create a second Profile model to hold that data and strictly limit access to the Profile model."

## Cryptography
The science which studies methods for encoding messages
The key is required for decoding
Cryptanalisis: the science for decoding without the key

## Hash Algorithms
Cryptographic Hash Algorithm (wooowwww cool name): takes a piece of data & produces a hash that is difficult to reverse -- same hash for identical data
Often used to check integrity of data

## Cypher Algorithms
Cryptographic Cypher Algorithm (even cooler name) takes a piece of data and a key and produced encrypted data. KEY, TOO.
tokenSeed: random unique string unique to a database, can be queried to produce the user who made the request

## Basic Authorization
Common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request.
username and password are joing with a ':' then "base64 encoded" and placed after the string 'Basic'. The string is set to the value of an Authorization  header, which a Server can decode to retrieve the username and password.

Then, validation response (token/key) so client can re-authenticare without having to continually send the username:password combo in plain text over the INTERNET. (base64 is not a form of encryption, client&server must use HTTPS for sensi info)

    let encoded = window.btoa('someusername:P@55w0rD!')
    // c29tZXVzZXJuYW1lOlBANTV3MHJEIQ==

    let decoded = window.atob('c29tZXVzZXJuYW1lOlBANTV3MHJEIQ==');
    // someusername:P@55w0rD!

    request({
      method: 'GET',
      url: 'https://api.example.com/login',
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Basic ${encoded}`,
      },
    })
    .then(handleLogin)
    .catch(handleLoginError)

node module (methods are not built in)

    let base64 = require('base-64');

    let string = 'someusername:P@55w0rD!';
    let encoded = base64.encode(string); // c29tZXVzZXJuYW1lOlBANTV3MHJEIQ==
    let decoded = base64.decode(encoded); // someusername:P@55w0rD!

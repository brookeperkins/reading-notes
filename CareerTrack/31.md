## Building Your Own Hooks (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html)

custom hooks: functions that start with "use" and may call other Hooks
we can set arguments and returns
every time a custom hook is used, all state and effects inside of it are completely isolated

## Rules of Hooks (https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)

only call hooks at the top level
only call hooks from react functions (not in normal JS functions)

## Guide to Learning React Hooks (https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/react-hooks-guide/#toc-custom-react-hooks)

Hooks can call other hooks
Can call useState and useEffect many times
useEffect is like the componentDidMount in class components
useContext helps make jsx cleaner
useReducer
inputRef
anything that can be a function can also be a react hook

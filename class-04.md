<h1> READING NOTES</h1>
  <h2>HTML & CSS // JON DUCKETT</h2>  
    <h3> Chapter 4: Links (pp 74-93)</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Links allow you to move from one webpage to another.
      <li>Can be from: one website to another, one page to another on the same site, one part of a page to another part of a page, can open in a new browser or tab, can link to start up an email program to address an email to someone.
      <li>They're created used < a>. Example < a href="www.google.com">Google</ a>
      <li>Absolute URL: the URL of a completely different website you're linking needs to be ABSOLUTE, meaning contains the main part of the URL (eg Google.com/...)
      <li>Relative URL: when linking to a page on your own website, no need to include the XYZ.com portion, just the name of the file (eg < a href="index.html")>Index</ a>. 
      <li>Every page & every image on a site has a URL.
      <li>Directories: top-level folder is known as ROOT folder. Relationships between folders are described like a family tree (a folder can be a parent, grandparent, and subsequent folders can be children, grandchildren, and so on.)
      <li>To link to a parent folder, one would write: < a href="../example.html> and to link to a GRANDparent folder one would write < a href="../../example.html>
      <li>Email links can be done with < a href="mailto:abc@example.com>< /a>
      <li>Can open link in a new window with target="_blank" eg < a href="www.google.com target="_blank">< /a>
      <li> Can link to a specific part of a page with ids and classes. (eg: < a href="#example_photo">< a> or < a href="#section">)
      </ul>

<h3> Chapter 15: Layout (pp 358-404)</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>DIV elements are often used as a containing element to group together sections of a page. 
      <li>Browsers display pages in a normal flow, unless you specify: relative, absolute, or fixed positionings. 
      <li>The float property moves content to the left/right of the page and can be useful to create multi-column layouts (floated items require a defined width).
      <li> Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. 
      <li> Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate relevance without scrolling).
      <li> Grids held create professional and flexible designs.
      <li> CSS frameworks provide rules for common tasks. 
      <li> You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
      </ul>

    <h3> Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects (pp 86-99)</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Browsers require detailed instructions (complex scripts can run thousands of lines). Functions organize this code.
      <li>Function

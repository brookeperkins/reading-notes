  <h2>HTML & CSS // JON DUCKETT</h2>  
    <h3> Chapter 3: Lists</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
      <li>Ordered lists use numbers. 
      <li> Definition lists are used to define terminology. 
      <li>Lists can be nested within one another. 
      </ul>

<h3> Chapter 13: Boxes</h3>
      <li>CSS treats HTML elements like it lives in its own box, and you can control: dimensions, borders, margins, padding, show/hide boxes. 
      <li>Box dimensions: width, height. Default size is just big enough to hold contents. Can specify size with pixels, ems (based on the size of the text within it), or percentages (as relates to the browser).
      <li>min-width, max-width: useful tools for ensuring legibility. Can be done with  min-height and max-height also.
      <li>overflow: when content is larger than the box. can be: hidden (simply hides extra content), scroll (adds a scrollbar).
      <li>can make boxes hidden with visibility: hidden. a blank space will appear in its place.
      <li>Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes can be made into block-level boxes.
      <li>CSS# has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders. 
      </ul>

    <h3> Chapter 4: Decisions & Loops</h3>
       <ul> 
        <li>Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.
        <li> Comparison operators ( === !=== == < > <= =>) are used to compare 2 operands. 
        <li> Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
        <li> if..else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, another if false
        <li> SWitch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
        <li> Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
        <li> All values evaluate to either truthy or FALSY. 
        <li> There are three types of loop: for, while, and do...while. Each repeats a set of statements. 
        </ul>

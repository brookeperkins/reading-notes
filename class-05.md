    <h3> Chapter 11: Color (pp 246-263)</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>Color is an important design element.
      <li>There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
      <li>Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
      <li>It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).
      <li>CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA. 
      <li> CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
       </ul>

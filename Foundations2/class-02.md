<ul>
<li>Atomic design: a way of thinking about the layout and components of a page
<li>Start big, work your way down:
    <li>PAGE: the page
    <li>TEMPLATE: page layout without actual content
    <li>ORGANISMS: large sections that can be easily extracted from the page
    <li>MOLECULES: sections within an organisim
    <li>ATOMS: the basic HTML elements that can't be broken down any further (eg labels, p tags, etc)
<li>Put components into folders representing the different atomic stages-- atoms, molecules, and organisms!
<li>Start small and work your way up
<li>For components to be reusable and composable, make them as small and as independent as possible!
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<li>UI Components or component-driven front-end development Storybook (https://storybook.js.org/) is helpful for component maintenance 
<li>Nested components: Ncan reuse styling patterns <li>UI architecture: focusing on composition of components
<li>problems with maintaining style guides or pattern libraries because they live outside of the codebase and design tools
<li>break down your features into composable components!!
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Multi-Table Queries with JOINs Normalization
<li>INNER JOIN is just JOIN
<li>OUTER JOINS OUTER, LEFT OUTER JOIN and LET JOIN
<li>SELECT DISTINCT vs DISTINCT (different): only returns the building but without duplicating
</ul>

## Database Normalization (Explained in Simple English) https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-database-normalization-explained-in-simple-english/

<ul>
<li>Database normalization: process used to organize a database into tables and columns
<li>The database table is where all the data in a database is stored
<li>Three reasons for Database Normalization: 
    <ul>
    <li>minimize duplicate data
    <li>minimize or avoid data modification issues
    <li>simplify queries
    </ul>
<li>Duplicate info is difficult to maintain, increases storage, decreases performace.
<li>Search and sort
<li>Forms of Database normalization: Progressive (3 normal forms) - 1NF, 2NF, 3NF
    <ul>
    <li>First normal form
    <li>Second normal form
    <li>Third normal form
    </ul>
</ul>

## Visual Representation of SQL Joins https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins

<ul>
<li>INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, OUTER JOIN, LEFT JOIN EXCLUDING INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN EXCLUDING INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN EXCLUDING INNER JOIN
<li>Two circles overlapping in the middle
</ul>

## Chapter 11: Understanding Joins -- wow so did not read all of this
<ul>
<li>JOIN: retrieve data from multiple tables in a single SELECT query
<li>FROM left table JOIN right table ON something_id = id
</ul>
